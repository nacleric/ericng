    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm a computer science student from Hunter College. Although I'm on a bit of a hiatus from university, 
      I have a huge passion for software development. As an aspiring developer my goal is to build software that can provide value to people's lives. 
      My favorite language is python and I mainly focus on back-end services. I'm not really aiming to be a dedicated front-end developer
      but I am proficient with HTML/CSS and Javascript.

      <h2>Thing's I'd like to improve upon</h2>
      <p> It's always nice to have a bit of humility so that we, as software developers can recognize our flaws and improve upon them. 
          One thing I'd like to improve on is to rely less on the power of frameworks and not take the tools I use for granted.
          Throughout my journey I'd like to be known as an engineer and not "that guy who only knows X framework"; because of this fear 
          of not wanting to drop into irrelevancy. I sort of have this "obsession" with trying to use vanilla javascript 
          so that I can prepare myself to pickup any framework without being puzzled by the "magic" it provides.This will probably make the learning process 
          will be much more tedious but I truly believe that throwing business logic out the window and "respecting the process" 
          is the best possible way to develop creativity and flexability.
